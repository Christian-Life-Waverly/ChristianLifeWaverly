Hale Roofing has made good progress this week on our new roof. 

They have removed the terra-cotta tiles from the parapet walls and installed wood blocking on the parapet walls. The metal sheathing is yet to be installed on top of the wood. They have also removed all of the old tires from the roof.

They have installed the new "fully adhered 60 mil reinforced TPO Membrane Roof System" on at least half of the approximately 7,900 square foot lower roof by end of day Friday November 21, 2025. Where the new roof system has been installed the old EPDM membrane has been removed.
