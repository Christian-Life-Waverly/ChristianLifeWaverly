God willing, we will begin a four sermon series on *The Birth of Christ in Luke* on Sunday November 30, 2025. Then on December 28 we will resume the series in James *(Let Steadfastness Have Its Full Effect)*.

Tentatively, we will consider:
* Nov 30 Luke 1:26-38 The Annunciation
* Dec 07 Luke 2:01-07 The Birth
* Dec 14 Luke 2:08-20 The Shepherds
* Dec 21 Luke 2:21-38 The Temple

We also plan to sing four Advent/Christmas/Epiphany hymns each Sunday.
