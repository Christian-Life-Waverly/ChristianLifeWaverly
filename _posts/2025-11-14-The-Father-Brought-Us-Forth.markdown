Our text for November 16 is James 1:16-18. We should take James seriously when he says "Do not be deceived" (v16). This command is not just a rhetorical flourish. James is giving us an important admonition to help us "let steadfastness have its full effect" (v4). Then in v17 James gives us a specific area of doctrine where believers can be deceived. Everything God does is good; every good gift comes from Him; God never changes so we do not need to be concerned about Him giving us bad gifts. Then in v18 James tells us about being born again. We conclude by looking at how we are born again: by the Word of Truth.

<h2>Paul's Gospel Summarized</h2>

>“<sup>1</sup>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, <sup>2</sup>and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you— unless you believed in vain. 
>
><sup>3</sup>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <sup>4</sup>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, <sup>5</sup>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <sup>6</sup>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. <sup>7</sup>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. <sup>8</sup>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.”
