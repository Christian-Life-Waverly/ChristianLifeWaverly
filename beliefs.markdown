This Statement of Faith is taken verbatim from our constitution. Below we have listed the [creeds and confessions](#creeds) (paraphrasing C H Spurgeon on the Second London Confession) to assist the reader in controversies, to confirm the reader in his or her faith, and to edify the reader in righteousness. The reader who disagrees on some point with the consensus of these documents ought to take great care. 

<h2 id="beliefs">Statement of Faith</h2>

1. We believe the Holy Bible is the inspired Word of God, without any error, the all-sufficient authority in matters of faith, doctrine, and Christian living.

2. We believe in one God, eternally existing in three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

3. We believe in the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, and that He is true God and man. He died on the cross for our sins. He rose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father and is now our High Priest and Advocate.

4. We believe that man was created in the image of God but fell into sin and is, therefore, lost. Only through regeneration by the work of the Holy Spirit can man’s salvation and spiritual life be obtained.

5. We believe that eternal salvation is the free gift of God, entirely apart from man’s works, and is possessed by any and all who have faith in and receive Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.

6. We believe in the personal, bodily, imminent, and glorious return of the Lord Jesus Christ and that His second coming inspires believers for dynamic and zealous life and service for Him while waiting for His return.

7. We believe in baptism by full immersion and that this symbolizes Christ’s death, burial and resurrection. Being baptized is a public declaration of faith in Christ’s atoning work and identifying with Him.

8. We believe in the Lord’s Table (Communion) as a remembrance of the cost of our sin and Christ’s propitiation. In taking communion, we remember what He did to bring us into right relationship with the Father and celebrate the victory, looking forward to His return.

9. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead, the everlasting blessedness of the saved in heaven, and the everlasting punishment and separation from God of the unsaved in hell.

10. We believe in the Holy Spirit empowering and members should pursue and use His gifts for the edifying of the Body of Christ.
